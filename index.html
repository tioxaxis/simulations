	<h1>TioX: Some thoughts for teachers.</h1>
	<p>Tiox is a set of animations for demonstrating some of the main ideas in Operations Management.   These include queueing, bottlenecks, Little's Law, the Newsvendor Problem, Inventory Management, Queueing System Design (economies of scale in queueing), and batching (the impact of batching decisions on flow time and throughput).  </p>
	<p>Each animation shows people or packages or both moving through a system and is designed as an aid to students' first exposure to these concepts.  Let's take queueing as an example to start with. Although one can observe people coming to a store or a bank and see that sometimes people wait to be served, we have no knowledge of or control over the rates of arrivals or the rates of service. The animation provides the student with the opportunity to observe a system knowing the arrival rate of customers and the service rate of the server and see how the system performs.  Crucially, it is then possible to adjust these rates and the variability in these rates and observe how the system performance (waiting time for customers in this case) changes.</p>
		
		<p>Many basic concepts in Operations Management involve understanding how sequences of events, such as a customers arriving at store, being served, and being checked out, will interact.  Although many ideas are straight forward, such as the rate a system can handle customers, is driven by the slowest stage of a process, it is helpful to actually see this a few times first.</p>
	<p>These animations were designed to act as a bridge for the students, to allow them to see the phenomenon of a bottleneck of a system limiting throughput, variability causing a queue to form, inventory in a store allowing customers to be served immediately, without the need for constant delivers.
		
		<p> These animations are not designed to replace the mathematics Operations Managers use to understand systems. They are not designed to be used to model real systems.  There are plenty of sophisticated comercial simulation systems for modeling real systems.  They are meant to be that bridge for the first time student.  To understand inventory systems, traditionally one draws a graph of on-hand inventory over time to show customers buying product and delivery of orders from a supplier.  One might say "Inventory is on the y-axis and time is on the x-axis."  Yet, to some first time Operations students the notion of customers arriving over time and drawing a graph of inventory going down to represent this may be a challenge.  It was that idea, "Time Is On the X-axis" that led to the acronym for these simulations (TIOX).  We hope that watching the inventory animation will help students expeditiously understand the connection between the events of customers and orders arriving and the inventory curves we all draw.</p>
	
	<p>In a 2006 article entitled "Web-based Simulations for Teaching Queueing, Little's Law, and Inventory Management," published in INFORMS Transactions on Education,  Robert Shumsky and I introduced earlier versions of three of these simulations.  The Flash and Shock-Wave versions of these at some point became unavailable and the link at the publisher no longer worked.   Robert Shumsky produced and updated Flash version of the animation for Queueing, and I produced a Java version for all three and several others.  As of 2020 Flash is no longer being supported by Adobe.  Java became problematic for use via a web browser much earlier. The Java version is still available and still runs fine on a laptop if you are willing to install the Jave Runtime System. Yet, the Java version was designed around a fixed screen size. It can appear small on a modern laptop, and thus small on the projector for class, and adjusing system settings to workaround this difficulty is awkward.   For these reasons among others, I am in the process of rewriting the animations in Javascript.  They should run in most modern browsers (although Chrome is suggested).</p>
	
	<p>Four of the animations have been reporduced: Queueing, Little's Law, News Vendor, and Inventory (handling both the standard Reorder Point/Reorder Quantity model and the Periodic Ordering and Order-up-to model.  Others will follow including one that simulates the "Face Game," a easy to run game for a early class to demonstrate the notions of flow time and throughput, and several that deal with batching issues, showing the implications of batching to flow time and throughput.</p>
	
	<p>If you have other ideas for an animation that would introduce a basic Operations Management concept feel free to contact me.  Perhaps we can design one together. Again my goal is to provide a bridge for first time students from what they see in the real world to the models we use in Operations Management.  The animations that I have used here have been intentially simple, for example, people and trucks. Stick figures are not intended to look like real people and the trucks don't move and act like real trucks but again, provide the bridge to first understanding these concepts related to say a retail store and then make the jump to other inventory systems, or people lining up in a straight line for a TSA agent is not realistic but may allow the student to imagine another situation such as requesting an appointment at a doctor's office and "waiting" in the scheduling system for the day of the appointment. </p>
